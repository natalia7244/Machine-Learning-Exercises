# Machine-Learning-Exercises
This repository contains various exercises and projects related to Machine Learning. Here, I practice fundamental ML concepts, including data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and optimization. The exercises cover topics such as regression, classification, clustering, and neural networks. Additionally, I work with popular libraries like Scikit-Lear or Pandas. Certificates from completed ML courses are also included, demonstrating my commitment to learning and improving my skills in this field.
